# Openscrib - File Sharing for students
This is a Scribd open and decentralized alternative (hope so).
A decentralized platform for sharing and discovering documents, built on IPFS.

## Brief Overview
Openscrib aims to be a decentralized, censorship-resistant to traditional document-sharing platforms like Scribd. Instead of relying on central servers, docs are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

## Problem solved
Current document-sharing platforms often rely on centralized infrastructure, making them vulnerable to censorship, single points of failure, and potentially restrictive access models (like mandatory subscriptions). Openscrib addresses these issues by leveraging decentralized technologies for greater user control, data performance and open access.

## Core Features
* **Upload Documents:** Securely upload documents (PDFs, ebooks, etc.) to the IPFS network.
* **Decentralized Storage:** FIles are stored on IPFS, identified by unique COntent Identifiers (CIDs).
* **Metadata Management:** ...
* **Discover & Download:** Search, browse, and download documents directly via IPFS gateways.
* **(Planned)** User Profiles / Identity (Optional).
* **(Planned)** Rating & Commenting System (Optional).
* **(Planned)** Content Pinning Incentives (Optional).
